# Google Maps Route to GPX File Converter 

A React application that converts Google Maps routes to GPX files for use in GPS devices

## Why I Built This

As a cyclist, I got really frustrated with my Wahoo device's routing. It kept sending me down tiny side streets and weird shortcuts that weren't great for cycling. But I noticed that Google Maps actually gives much better cycling routes - it seems to understand which roads are better for bikes. The problem was, I couldn't easily get these Google Maps routes onto my Wahoo. I'd find a fast route on Google Maps, but then I'd be stuck trying to recreate it manually on my Wahoo, which was a pain. So I built this tool to take my Google Maps routes and convert them to GPX files that work with my Wahoo, using Google's better routing algorithm instead of Wahoo's.
